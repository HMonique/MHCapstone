          Welcome to Crafty Corner! We are a small woman-owned minority business located in downtown Manhattan near South Street Seaport, Chinatown, FiDi. 
          Crafty Corner specializes in hand crocheted amigurumis. An Amigurumi is a Japanese art form that involves making small, stuffed toys by knitting or crocheting yarn. 
          We have a variety of amigurumis ready to be taken home by you or your loved ones. We take great care to make sure only the finest 
          quality materials are used during construction of our products.
