          Welcome to Crafty Corner! We are a small woman-owned minority made to order business located in downtown Manhattan near South Street Seaport, Chinatown, FiDi. 
          Crafty Corner was established in 2024 by Monique Harris as a way to showcase her love for crochet. Monique learned how to crochet from her aunt 
          and grandmother. She decided to turn her passion into a business and share her love for crochet with the world. Also, as a single mother to a teenage daughter,
          Monique gets to share this experience with her daughter and teach her the art of crochet.

          quality materials are used during construction of our products. We also have a variety of supplies available for purchase, as well as, learning videos for 
          anyone who is interested in learning how to crochet.
